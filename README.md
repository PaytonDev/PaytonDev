### Hi there 👋. I'm Bree.

Frontend engineer with a proven ability to wholly deliver on expectations with clear communication in collaborative
settings under strict and often tight time constraints. In 6 days, I designed, developed, deployed, and documented
my React app, Here Me Out, as a part of a coding challenge for Twitch. With Cox Automotive, I partnered with a
team of Implementation Specialists and consolidated technical communication between the Implementation, Product,
Sales, and Engineering teams and presented the information to clients in daily training. I expanded my coding and
teamwork acumen through a 1,000+ hour coding Bootcamp focused on React and Express where I participated in
weekly code reviews and pair coding with senior engineers. I’m excited to use these skills to collaborate with teams
that want to improve their communication and processes in order to create timely and best possible experiences
for the end users, clients, and fellow developers.
